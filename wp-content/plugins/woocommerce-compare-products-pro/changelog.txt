*** Compare Products Pro Changelog ***

2013.02.23 - version 2.0.7
* Feature: All plugin code updated to be 100% compatible with WooCommerce version 2.0 and backwards.
* Feature: Replaced Compare pop-up fly out powered by Fancybox and Lightbox tools with Product Comparisons opening in a new window. WooCommerce Version 2.0 uses PrettyPhoto as the pop-up tool and we found supporting 3 pop-up scripts, PrettyPhoto, Fancybox and Lightbox very buggy and troublesome so have completely replaced it.
* Feature: Added show Comparison in new widow options. Option 1. Show the product Comparison in an on-screen pop-up window or Option 2. Show Comparisons in a new window.
* Feature: Added Fixed Features Title column. This means when more than 3 products are being compared in the pop up window or on page comparison the products scroll under the Features title column - the user always can see what product features are being compared.
* Feature: Added Compared Table scrolls horizontal and vertical via the window scrollers not by scrollers on an inner container. Looks fantastic.
