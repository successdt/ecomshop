WooCommerce Compare Products adds a product Comparison feature to any or all products on your WooCommerce site. Site users click a button or a link to add products to their compare list in the sidebar widget area.

Once products are added to the Compare sidebar widget users click the Compare button and the products they have added show side-by-side with all features in a beautiful mac like pop up screen. In that screen they can compare products prices and features. They can narrow their choices down by removing products. From the pop up screen they can add products to their shopping cart, print the results or return to the product page and continue to add other products.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=
When can I use this plugin? =

You can use this plugin when you have installed the WooCommerce plugin.

= How do I change the Color of the Button to match my theme? = It is an easy task to change the color of the button - but you will need some coding knowledge.

All objects in the plugin have a class so you can style for them. Using an ftp client open the style.css in your theme.

Look for the style of your themes buttons below is an example - it will look something like this

#wrap input[type="submit"], #wrap input[type="button"] {
background: url('images/bg-button.png') no-repeat scroll right top transparent;
border: 1px solid #153B94;
border-radius: 5px 5px 5px 5px;
box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px #333333;
color: #FFFFFF;
cursor: pointer;
font-size: 12px;
padding: 9px 27px 7px 10px;
}

Once you have found that in themes style.css directory then add that style into your themes style.css under the class name 'bt_compare_this' which is for the Compare button on the product pages and class name 'compare_button_go' for the Compare button in the sidebar widget. This is how it would look using the example above as the style for the button.

input.bt_compare_this {
background: url('images/bg-button.png') no-repeat scroll right top transparent;
border: 1px solid #153B94;
border-radius: 5px 5px 5px 5px;
box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px #333333;
color: #FFFFFF;
cursor: pointer;
font-size: 12px;
padding: 9px 27px 7px 10px;
}

This will then mean that style will apply for all input tag in div that has the class compare_button_container to change the sidebar widget button you do the same but use the class 'compare_button_go'
